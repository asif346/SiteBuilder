This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

## Database (Neon + Drizzle)

- **App** uses `drizzle-orm/neon-http` (see `config/db.ts`).
- **CLI**: `npx drizzle-kit generate` (local), `npx drizzle-kit pull` / `npx drizzle-kit migrate` (need DB access).

### If `drizzle-kit pull` or `migrate` times out (ETIMEDOUT)

Your network is blocking or delaying outbound connections to Neon (both WebSocket and TCP to Neon’s IPs). Fix it from the network side:

1. **Use another network** – e.g. mobile hotspot or different Wi‑Fi, then run:
   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit pull    # introspect schema
   npm run db:migrate      # apply migrations (if you have this script)
   ```
2. **Run from the cloud** – e.g. run migrations in CI (GitHub Actions, etc.) or from a Vercel build step where outbound access to Neon works.
3. **Use Neon’s SQL Editor** – In [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech) → SQL Editor, run your migration SQL (e.g. from `drizzle/*.sql`) or inspect tables and keep `config/schema.ts` in sync by hand.

Your app may still work when deployed (e.g. on Vercel) because serverless runtimes often have different outbound access than your local machine.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
